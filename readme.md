# Macro Polo

-------------------

Ever had to somehow introduce hardening for macros in Office documents, but no one knows if a doc has a macro in it?<br>
This is for you.

Macro Polo add a button to the home page of Word and Excel<br>
![MP](Images/ribbon.png)

Pressing this will display one of the following message under the ribbon bar, depending on macro settings and config:

No macro in the document:<br>
![MP](Images/no_macro.png)

Document has a signed macro, but you do not have permission to run it:<br>
![MP](Images/signed_not_allowed.png)

Document has an unsigned macro, but you do not have permission to run it:<br>
![MP](Images/not_signed_not_allowed.png)

Document has a signed macro, and you have permission to run it:
![MP](Images/signed_allowed.png)

Document has an unsigned macro, and you have permission to run it:
![MP](Images/not_signed_allowed.png)

Testing, no warranties, use at own risk, blah blah blah
